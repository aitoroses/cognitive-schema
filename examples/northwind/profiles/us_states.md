# Table us_states Profile

## Overview
The `us_states` table is designed to provide detailed information about the individual states of the United States. It encapsulates key attributes, such as the state name, abbreviation, and geographical region. This table serves as a foundational dataset for applications that may require state-specific information, including demographic analysis, regional studies, or mapping purposes.

## Columns

| Name           | Description                                      | Type   | Sample Data                         |

## Insights
From the sample data provided, several notable patterns and insights emerge regarding the distribution and characteristics of the states:

1. **Geographical Regions**: 
    - The sample includes states from various regions, including North, South, East, West, and Midwest. The Southern region appears to have a higher representation, with Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Kansas, suggesting a geographical clustering of states with similar cultural or socioeconomic traits.
    
2. **State Representation**: 
    - The dataset features a mix of states from different regions but lacks representation from certain areas, such as the Northwest or Northeast. This could indicate potential biases in the dataset's contents or its design depending on its intended use.

3. **Diversity in State Abbr**: 
    - Each state has a unique abbreviation, and there is a recognizable pattern in how these abbreviations are formed, generally derived from the state's name. However, the inclusion of territories, such as "District of Columbia," hints at the potential for expanding this table to include additional regions beyond individual states.

4. **Sample Limitation**:
    - Since this is a limited sample from a larger dataset, it must be noted that any patterns observed may not represent broader trends of all states. Further analysis of the entire dataset would be needed to draw definitive conclusions regarding representation and regional characteristics.

This profile provides an overview of the `us_states` table and highlights the importance of understanding geographical and political entities within the United States for various analytical applications.
