# Table region profile

## Overview
The `region` table serves to categorize and identify distinct geographical regions relevant to the broader context in which it is applied. Each region is assigned a unique identifier, which helps in data referencing and organization. This table is foundational for various applications, such as regional analysis, reporting, and data aggregation based on geographical distribution.

## Columns

| Name               | Description                                             | Type     | Sample Data               |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| region_id          | A unique identifier for each region                    | Number   | 1, 2, 3, 4                |
| region_description | A textual description of the geographical region       | String   | Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern |

## Insights
Analyzing the sample data from the `region` table reveals several observations:

1. **Geographical Diversity**: The table includes a balanced representation of the four cardinal directions—Eastern, Western, Northern, and Southern. This implies a potential focus on diverse geographical metrics or characteristics pertinent to each of these regions.

2. **Simplicity in Structure**: The straightforward structure of the table, with only two columns, suggests that the primary focus is on identifying regions rather than on complex attributes or metrics. This highlights its role as a reference table that can link to more detailed datasets.

3. **Data Scalability**: Given the clear naming conventions and unique identifiers, this table can easily be expanded to accommodate additional regions or sub-regions if required. More granular subdivisions might enhance regional analysis.

4. **Potential for Analysis**: As more data is collected and aligned with this `region` table—such as demographic, economic, or environmental data—this foundational structure will enable more comprehensive regional analyses in various domains.

Overall, the `region` table is an essential component for organizing geographical information, providing a basis for further analytical endeavors. While the sample size is limited, it establishes a framework around which additional data can be organized and analyzed effectively.
