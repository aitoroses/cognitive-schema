# Table Categories Profile

## Overview
The 'categories' table serves as a classification framework for various types of products, primarily food and beverages. By organizing items into distinct categories, this table aids in inventory management, product marketing, and consumer navigation through a potential catalog of offerings. Each category is characterized by a unique identifier, a descriptive name, a detailed explanation, and potentially a related image, making it easier for users to understand and identify product types.
