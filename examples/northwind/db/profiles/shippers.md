Each record in the table provides a unique identifier for the shipper, the name of the shipping company, and a contact phone number. This data is crucial for businesses that rely on these shippers to facilitate their delivery operations and manage supply chain logistics effectively.

## Insights
From the sample data, we can observe several notable patterns and insights:

1. **Variety of Shipping Providers**: The table displays a range of shipping companies from small local providers (e.g., Speedy Express) to large multinational corporations (e.g., UPS and DHL). This diversity caters to various logistical needs, from local deliveries to international shipping.

2. **Phone Number Format Variations**: The phone numbers show different formatting styles. Some use area codes with parentheses and dashes (e.g., (503) 555-9831), while others are formatted with toll-free numbers (e.g., 1-800-222-0451). This inconsistency might indicate varying regional practices or the nature of services provided (local vs. national).

3. **Potential for Further Analysis**: While the current data is limited in scope, it lays the groundwork for identifying trends related to pricing, reliability, and service areas for each provider. Further data collection could elucidate preferred shippers based on specific delivery needs or timelines.

4. **Identifying Key Players**: Companies like UPS and DHL are recognized globally, which suggests that they may handle a significant volume of shipments. Understanding the appeal and performance metrics of such companies could be beneficial for customers seeking dependable shipping options.

Given these insights, the `shippers` table could serve as a foundational component for a logistics management system, helping businesses to choose appropriate shipping partners tailored to their operational needs.
